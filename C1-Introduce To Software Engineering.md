When we request / interact with a website:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12b100a0-26fc-4fdb-8f60-5cc6802d5bee)

### 📂Most websites contain **static** and **dynamic elements** to provide the best user experience:
- **Static Element:** Previously stored on the server.
  - Example: HTML, CSS, JS
- **Dynamic Element:** Generated each time when requested by clients.
  - Example: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, CMS, Database

### 📂Most websites are designed to be:
- **Reactive**: Responding to user interactions.
- **Responsive**: Adapting to different screen sizes.

---

## 💻**Cloud App**

- Built to work seamlessly with cloud-based back-end infrastructure.
- Supports **data storage**, **processing**, and other **scalable** and **resilient** services.

---

## 💻**Front-End**

- Handles everything happening on the client-side:
  - **HTML**: Creates the physical structure (text, links, images, videos).
  - **CSS**: Adds styles like colors, fonts, and compatibility across browsers.
  - **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the website.

### 📂Front-End Enhancements:
- **SASS**: CSS extension with more powerful functions.
- **LESS**: Learner Style Sheet compiled into CSS.
